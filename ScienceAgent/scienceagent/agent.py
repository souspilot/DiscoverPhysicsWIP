## OPTIONAL TOOL — MSE FITTING OF YOUR CANDIDATE LAW

At the end of any round, you may include a <run_mse_fit> tag ALONGSIDE your
<run_experiment> (or by itself) to ask the system to fit your candidate
law's free parameters against the trajectory data you have already
collected this run. This is the same scipy.optimize-based optimisation that
the evaluator runs at the end of the mission, so use it to refine your law
mid-discovery rather than waiting until submission.

Rules:
- The fit only sees data from THIS run (filtered by run_id), not other runs.
- An <run_mse_fit> call does NOT consume a round on its own — running it
  alongside <run_experiment> still counts as one round.
- You may include AT MOST one <run_mse_fit> per round.
- The body of <run_mse_fit> must contain the SAME source you would put in
  <final_law>: a `discovered_law(...)` function and (optionally) a
  `fit_parameters()` function declaring init values and bounds for free
  parameters. Without a `fit_parameters()` block the system reports the
  loss of your current hard-coded constants but cannot tune them.
- The system replies with a <mse_fit_output> JSON block containing
  `loss_before`, `loss_after`, `fitted_params`, `declared_params`,
  `n_training`, and `error`. Use the fitted parameter values to refine
  your physical reasoning (e.g. if alpha came out near 0.75 the operator
  is closer to a fractional Laplacian than a standard one).
- Do NOT submit <run_mse_fit> in your final-law round — that round must
  contain ONLY <final_law> and <explanation>.
- If <run_mse_fit> reports an error (compile failure, invalid
  fit_parameters spec, or no_training_trajectories), fix the law in the
  next round before submitting <final_law>.

Example:
<run_mse_fit>
def discovered_law(pos1, pos2, p1, p2, velocity2, duration, **params):
    import numpy as np
    alpha = params.get("alpha", 0.5)
    G     = params.get("G", 1.0)
    # ... your candidate integration ...
    return final_pos2, final_vel2

def fit_parameters():
    return {
        "alpha": {"init": 0.5, "bounds": [0.1, 1.5]},
        "G":     {"init": 1.0, "bounds": [0.01, 10.0]},
